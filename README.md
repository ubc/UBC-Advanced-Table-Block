== Description ==

This block is a combination of work from Elaine Shannon at St Mary's Texas, The Advanced Gutenberg plugin, and our own work at UBC.

Elaine's post ( https://sites.stmarytx.edu/webelaine/2019/05/20/gutenberg-building-a-more-accessible-table-block/) helped inspire us to build an accessible, full-featured, table block that allows users to display tabular data.

The folks at Advanced Gutenberg have a block which allows folks to merge cells in rows or columns.

We required an accessible table block, that allows captions, cell merging, and custom styles. This, with the help of the folks listed above, is the end result.
